        ### Short introduction:
        This page has been created for testing LLM's (OpenAI's GPT-4) capabilities in finding conflicts from construction 
        industry documents. The results will be reported in a thesis _Generative AI for identifying conflicts in 
        construction industry documents_ written by _Tapio Pulkkinen_. You can find more 
        information of this thesis and about the work from the 'About this thesis work' -page. 
        
        #### How you should use this:
        Note that it is important to fulfill all the asked variables to be able to use the tests properly. **NOTE that all variables will reset if you refresh the page!**
        
        1. If you need instructions, head to the 'Instructions for the testbench'-page from the left sidebar.
        2. Go to the 'Database manager'-page to set up database connection. You can also use in-memory storage but it is not recommended.
        3. Go to the 'Doc and text handling'-page and load the file or files you wish to use in conflict search.
        5. Go to the 'LLM setup'-page and fulfill the large language model's access credentials and parameters. OpenAI's endpoint is recommended.
        6. Go to the 'test #1 - LLM conversation'-page and choose a proper prompt for your use case. You can also write your own prompt is you wish. Then test set-up and log the initial results there.
        7. Do the other tests that can be found from the left side bar.
