# Utility Suite for Knowledge Graph and LLM Integration

This repository contains the code for a Python-based utility suite designed for managing knowledge graphs and integrating language learning models (LLMs). The suite includes various modules for database connections, query handling, and LLM operations, primarily aimed at research and development purposes.

## Contents
- `main.py` - The main script that initializes and coordinates other modules.
- `cypher_queries.py` - Contains Cypher queries for Neo4j databases.
- `dumb_secrets.py` - Handles secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information.
- `json_extender.py` - Extends and manipulates JSON data structures.
- `kg_llm_handler.py` - Manages interactions between knowledge graphs and LLMs.
- `llm_queries.py` - Contains the queries for LLMs.
- `neo4j_connector.py` - Provides functionality for connecting to and managing Neo4j graph databases.
