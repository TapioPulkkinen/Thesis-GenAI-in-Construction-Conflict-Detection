## Thesis-GenAI-in-Construction-Conflict-Detection

This repository contains the code developed for a thesis that explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting conflicts within the construction domain. The primary focus of the thesis was to evaluate the potential of these models in identifying conflicts, rather than to produce a fully functional application.

### Important Notes

- **Purpose**: The code was created solely for testing and research purposes as part of an academic study. It is not intended for production use.
- **Stability**: Given the experimental nature of the code, it is likely to contain bugs and may not function as expected in all scenarios.
- **Support**: Fixes or assistance will only be provided upon reasonable request. Please understand that the code is provided "as-is" without guarantees of comprehensive support.
- **Distribution**: This code is not meant to be distributed as a ready-to-use program. It serves as a demonstration of the study's findings and methodologies.

### Repository Structure

- `Pseudonymization_software/`: Contains code related to the pseudonymization processes used in the study.
- `Testing_software/`: Includes various scripts and tools used for testing the conflict detection capabilities of LLMs.

### Disclaimer

By using this code, you acknowledge that it was developed for research purposes and is not intended for production use. The repository aims to showcase the experimental procedures and results of the study, rather than to provide a fully-fledged application.
